  # Along with the card, we also have a guess. Users will enter a guess and weâ€™re going to have to figure out if the guess is correct. Use TDD to create this interaction pattern:
  #
  # card = Card.new("10", "Hearts")
  # guess = Guess.new("10 of Hearts", card)
  # guess.card
  # => #<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @value="10", @suit="Hearts">
  # guess.response
  # => "10 of Hearts"
  # guess.correct?
  # => true
  # guess.feedback
  # => "Correct!"
  # We also want to make sure that incorrect guesses are also handled properly.
  #
  # card = Card.new("Queen", "Clubs")
  # guess = Guess.new("2 of Diamonds", card)
  # guess.card
  # => #<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @value = "Queen", @suit="Clubs">
  # guess.response
  # => "2 of Diamonds"
  # guess.correct?
  # => false
  # guess.feedback
  # => "Incorrect."
